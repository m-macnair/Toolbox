This isn't so much a style guide as a reminder as to what I want to do :D

Variable names
	$p = $params - something specific to an operation
	$c = $conf (or Catalyst's $c which is the same thing really) - configuration or configuration overrides 
	my ($always,$always,%$sometimes) = @_; - Prone to backfire when a sub balloons, but href all day every day gets tiring. Exception is if there are more than 3 mandatory params in which case, ($self,$href)

DB design
	items
	item_properties.item_id
	item_property_nested.item_property_id
