This isn't so much a style guide as a reminder as to what I want to do :D
Perl
	Variable names
		$p = $params - something specific to an operation
		$c = $conf (or Catalyst's $c which is the same thing really) - configuration or configuration overrides 
		On principle, up to two mandatory parameters and a href of optionals, or one href of named parameters
	Returns
		When A sub only does one thing and dies other wise
			return 1 value
		Otherwise
			return a href with one of 
				{ pass => 1 } - when 'it worked' is all the sub does
				{ pass => 'key' , key => $processed value } - when multiple possible return conditions exist, to indicate which one applied
				{ fail => $why }
	Sigils
		% and @ discouraged except when it's 100% certain that they'll never leave a given sub. References at all other times

	Misc
		snake_case on principle 
		<something> unless test(); for single actions 
DB
	design
		items
		item_properties.item_id
		item_property_nested.item_property_id
		
		all ints are big ints unless it's absolutely certain they aren't
		currency is stored in the smallest denomination of the currency, as integer, and big int
		When possible, strings are split out into their own table
