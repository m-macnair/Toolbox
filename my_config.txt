How I (want to) do things:

Principles
	Perl First, C++ When Performance Matters, PHP when $it doesn't matter, Python when there's no alternative
	ORM should be considered at the overarching layer, *not* for subsystems. If ORM seems to be a good idea for a subsystem, it's *probably* not been broken down far enough
	snake_case on principle
	`# TODO `(or equivalent comment marker) as the first part of a line or the first line in a todo comment
	validation/mangling occurs at the public method level, so that private methods can just Do The Thing

Layout - Yet to actually do this


	Critical Path
		Init
		Public Wrappers

	Facilitators
		Manglers
	Utility
		Generic Functions
		Refactor Candidates
	Private Wrappers
		Lazy
		For Children

Perl
	TitleCase when referring to another module or library - and the library itself is title case
		$p = $params - something specific to an operation
		$c = $conf (or Catalyst's $c which is the same thing really) - configuration or configuration overrides 
	On principle, up to two mandatory parameters and a href of optionals, or one href of named parameters if there's more than 2 mandatory
	Returns
		When a sub only does one thing and dies other wise
			return 1 value
		Otherwise
			return a href with one of 
				{ pass => $always_truthy } - when 'it worked' is all the sub does
				{ pass => 'some_key' , some_key => $may_be_falsey } - when multiple possible return conditions exist, to indicate which one applied
				{ pass => 'some_key' , some_key => $may_be_falsey , any => 'other', value =>'produced' }
				{ fail => $why }
	Sigils
		% and @ discouraged except when it's 100% certain that they'll never leave a given sub. References at all other times. Helps to indicate 'this value only matters here' vs 'this value is sent/came from elsewhere'
	Tests
		die 'not implemented' to be returned for parent class methods that should be overwritten, dir 'Not Yet Implemented' for methods that are unique
	Misc
		<something> unless test(); for single actions 
	
DB
	design
		items
		item_properties.item_id
		item_property_nested.item_property_id

		all ints are big ints unless it's absolutely certain they aren't
		currency is stored in the smallest denomination of the currency, as integer, and big int
		When possible, strings are split out into their own table

	names
		table names that must conceptually start with a number always start with an underscore, for Dat Portability in sqlite
