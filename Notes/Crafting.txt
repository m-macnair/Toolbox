Bob Martin:
1. If you do anything to software that makes it hard to change, you have thwarted the reason software exists; you have harmed the system you are working on. 
2. The test suite you want is the test suite that allows you to make a decision when it passes.
3. If you have a test suite that you trust with your life, you can clean the code.
4. Good architecture allows major decisions to be deferred.
5. The ultimate failure of a software developer [is] when a business, that is not technically competent, says you're not touching that module.

Observations
1. The purpose of comments is to express the 'why', not necessarily the 'how' as that should be self evident
